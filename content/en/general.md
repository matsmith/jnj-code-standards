# Front-End Code Standards

## General

This document contains the formatting guidelines and best practices for the front-end web development team at Isobar. There are many ways of leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website - each item here represents either (1) a decision we've made favoring one method over its alternatives or (2) a reminder to follow existing standards. What this document is _not_ is a series of explanations as to how front-end technologies work; a basic familiarity is assumed. It also does _not_ provide evaluations of the pros and cons of various alternatives; we pick what we consider to be the best one and run with it. Any issues that don't yet have a clear solution are not listed here.

Our motivations in creating this document are to (1) foster code consistency across our projects to facilitate ease of maintenance and onboarding and (2) educate new developers on how best to create robust, performant, and accessible websites.

### Goals
 - Consistency
 - Professional standards
 - Pillars of Front-end Development
 - Architectural thinking

### Getting Started
 - Identify Deliverables
 - Development vs Production
 - Browser and device requirements  

### General Standards
 - Compression
 - Maintainabilty
 - Readability
 - Comments

(redundant below)

### Formatting

#### Indentation

For all code languages, we use soft tabs comprised of four spaces per tab. Hitting the Tab key in your text editor should generate four space characters rather than one tab character. This results in our code appearing identical across platforms.

#### Readability

We encourage liberal use of whitespace, comments, and descriptive variable names as appropriate for writing easy-to-read code. There is no need to write code in an obfuscated or compressed way for the purpose of file-size savings; we will use automated server-side or build processes to concatenate, minify, and gzip all static client-side code (such as CSS and JavaScript).
